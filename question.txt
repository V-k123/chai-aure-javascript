# data types are the define the type of values that a variable  can hold.

# types of primitive datatypes
a-Number:Reprsent numeric value  ,including integers and floating point  number.

# string : Reprsent a sequence of character  enclosed in single or double quotes.

# Boolean :Reprsent a logical entity with two values : true or false.

# undefined: Reprsent the abscence of  a value or an uninitialized variable.
example:- 
# what is the difference  between null and undefined;
ans- think you a hava a variable as a box .when we say a box h as null inside ,it like having an empty box .the box exist ,but there nothing valuable or meaningful inside it.
undefined-
you have  a gift box  and untill you open it you dont,t know what's inside right now it,s undefined you haven,t checked or filled  it with anything yet.
# what is the purpose of  type of operator in javascript.
ans-var myName="vivek";
console.log(myName);
console.log(typeof myName);
# explain the concept of the truthy and falsy values in javascript .provide example.
ans-In javascript , values are either considered "truthy" or "falsy" when evaluted in a Boolean context.

 # truthy values are treated  as a true when used in condition .exmple includes:
true,
any non-empty string("hello")
Any non zero number (42)
Arrays and objects ,even if they are not empty

falsy values are treated as false in  Boolean context.exmple includes:
false 
0
..(an empty string)
null
undefined
NaN (Not a number)
# TODO Key difference :
parseInt is used for converting to integers and ignores anything after the decimal point .
parsefloat is used for converting to floating-point numbers ,preserving the decimal part. both function will attempt to convert as m uch of the strings as possible untill an invalid character is encountered.

# when we will not get an output-
console.log(parseInt("&123"));
output -NaN
NaN (input can,t be converted to an integer)


// what is the purpose of the NaN value in javascript
NaN Stands for "Not a number" and is returned when a mathematical operation doesn't yield  a valid number.
Also  to check wheather    a  value is  number or not we can use  isNaN() function.
