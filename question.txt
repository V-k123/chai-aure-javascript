# in javascript ,the + sign is not only used for arithmetic addition but also for string concatenation .when the + operator is used with Strings, it concatenates the strings together .it important to note that if any operand of the + operator is a stirng , javascript will treat the other operands as strings as well,resulting in string concatenation .if  both operands are numbers ,the + operator performs numeric adding
# type coercion is the automatic conversion of "values" from one data type to another.
it is a fundamental part of javascript and can be used to make code more redable and efficient.
there are two types of coericon in javascript implicit and explicit .implicit coercion is done manually by the programmer.
